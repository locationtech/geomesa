# Security Policy

GeoMesa follows the [Eclipse Vulnerability Reporting Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy.php).
Vulnerabilities are tracked by the Eclipse security team, in cooperation with the GeoMesa committers. Fixing
vulnerabilities is done by the GeoMesa committers, with assistance and guidance from the security team.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

In the case of a suspected vulnerability, do **not** use any public GeoMesa forum (mailing list, chat or issue tracker).
Instead, contact the [Eclipse Security Team](mailto:security@eclipse.org) directly.

## Supported Versions

The GeoMesa committers will evaluate the impact and scope of any vulnerabilities with guidance from the Eclipse
security team, and apply patches to previous releases as deemed necessary.
