/**
  * Scala implementation of HyperLogLog (HLL) algorithm from this paper:
  * <p/>
  * http://algo.inria.fr/flajolet/Publications/FlFuGaMe07.pdf
  * <p/>
  * HLL is an improved version of LogLog that is capable of estimating
  * the cardinality of a set with accuracy = 1.04/sqrt(m) where
  * m = math.pow(2, b).  So we can control accuracy vs space usage by increasing
  * or decreasing b.
  * <p/>
  * The main benefit of using HLL over LL is that it only requires 64%
  * of the space that LL does to get the same accuracy.
  * <p/>
  * This implementation implements a single counter.  If a large (millions)
  * number of counters are required you may want to refer to:
  * <p/>
  * http://dsiutils.dsi.unimi.it/
  * <p/>
  * It has a more complex implementation of HLL that supports multiple counters
  * in a single object, drastically reducing the java overhead from creating
  * a large number of objects.
  * <p/>
  * This implementation leveraged a javascript implementation that Yammer has
  * been working on:
  * <p/>
  * https://github.com/yammer/probablyjs
  * <p>
  * Note that this implementation does not include the long range correction function
  * defined in the original paper.  Empirical evidence shows that the correction
  * function causes more harm than good.
  * </p>
  * <p/>
  * <p>
  * Users have different motivations to use different types of hashing functions.
  * Rather than try to keep up with all available hash functions and to remove
  * the concern of causing future binary incompatibilities this class allows clients
  * to offer the value in hashed int or long form.  This way clients are free
  * to change their hash function on their own time line.  We recommend using Google's
  * Guava Murmur3_128 implementation as it provides good performance and speed when
  * high precision is required.  In our tests the 32bit MurmurHash function included
  * in this project is faster and produces better results than the 32 bit murmur3
  * implementation google provides.
  * </p>
