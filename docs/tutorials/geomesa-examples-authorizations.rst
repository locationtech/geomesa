GeoMesa Authorizations
======================

This tutorial demonstrates the ways you can apply data-level security
to GeoMesa. It is a more advanced tutorial; you should already be familiar
with the basics of GeoMesa and GeoServer. This tutorial targets Accumulo -
GeoMesa also supports HBase visibilities through the same mechanisms, but the
HBase configuration required is not covered here. See :ref:`hbase_visibilities`
for more information on HBase.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to:

1. Set visibilities on your data during ingestion into GeoMesa
2. Apply authorizations to your queries through GeoMesa
3. Implement user authorizations through the GeoMesa GeoServer plugin,
   using PKI certs to authenticate with GeoServer and LDAP to store
   authorizations

Background
----------

Visibilities and Authorizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

One of the most powerful features of Accumulo is the implementation of
cell-level security, using **visibilities** and **authorizations**. Data
that is protected by visibilities can only be seen by users that have
the corresponding authorizations. This allows for the fine-grained
protection of data, based on arbitrary labels.

.. note::

    Authorizations are distinct from table-level
    permissions, and operate at a much finer grain.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Public key infrastructure can be used to securely authenticate end
users. In PKI, a **certificate authority** (CA) will issue digital
certificates that verify that a particular public key belongs to a
particular individual. Other users can then trust that certificate
because it has been digitally signed by the CA.

In this tutorial, the keys used are not provided by trusted CAs. As
such, it is necessary to import the CA's certificate into the Java
keystore, which allows Java (and by extension Tomcat) to trust any keys
verified by the CA.

PKI solves the issue of **authentication** (*who* a user is) but not
**authorization** (*what* a user can do). For this tutorial,
authorization is provided by an LDAP server.

Prerequisites
-------------

Before you begin, you must have the following:

-  `Java <http://java.oracle.com/>`__ JDK 1.8
-  Apache `Maven <http://maven.apache.org/>`__ |maven_version|
-  a GitHub client
-  an Accumulo |accumulo_required_version| instance
-  an Accumulo user that has both create-table and write permissions
-  the GeoMesa distributed runtime installed for your instance

If you are not familiar with Accumulo authorizations, you should review
the relevant Accumulo
`documentation <http://accumulo.apache.org/1.7/accumulo_user_manual.html#_security>`__,
with more examples `here <http://accumulo.apache.org/1.7/examples/visibility.html>`__.

About this Tutorial
-------------------

This tutorial operates by inserting and then querying several thousand features.
The features are inserted with visibility labels, and then queried with two different users
to show how authorizations work.

Visibilities in GeoMesa
-----------------------

GeoMesa supports setting the visibility for each feature that is written. This
can be set through user data in a simple feature:

.. code-block:: java

    SimpleFeature sf = ...;
    // set user data directly
    sf.getUserData().put(SecurityUtils.FEATURE_VISIBILITY, "user&admin");
    // alternatively, use static utility methods
    org.locationtech.geomesa.security.SecurityUtils.setFeatureVisibilities(sf, "user", "admin");

For more information on feature-level visibilities, see :doc:`./geomesa-examples-featurelevelvis`.

Authorizations in GeoMesa
-------------------------

When performing a query, GeoMesa delegates the retrieval of
authorizations to **service providers** that implement the following
interface:

.. code-block:: java

    package org.locationtech.geomesa.security;

    public interface AuthorizationsProvider {

        /**
         * Gets the authorizations for the current context. This may change over time
         * (e.g. in a multi-user environment), so the result should not be cached.
         *
         * @return
         */
        List<String> getAuthorizations();

        /**
         * Configures this instance with parameters passed into the DataStoreFinder
         *
         * @param params
         */
        void configure(Map<String, Serializable> params);
    }

When a GeoMesa ``DataStore`` is instantiated, it will scan for available
service providers. Third-party implementations can be enabled by placing
them on the classpath and including a special service descriptor file.
See the Oracle
`Javadoc <https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ServiceLoader.html>`__
for details on implementing a service provider.

The GeoMesa ``DataStore`` will call ``configure()`` on the
``AuthorizationsProvider`` implementation, passing in the parameter map
from the call to ``DataStoreFinder.getDataStore(Map params)``. This
allows the ``AuthorizationsProvider`` to configure itself based on the
environment.

To ensure that the correct ``AuthorizationsProvider`` is used, GeoMesa
will throw an exception if multiple third-party service providers are
found on the classpath. In this scenario, the particular service
provider class to use can be specified by the following system property:

.. code-block:: java

    AuthorizationsProvider.AUTH_PROVIDER_SYS_PROPERTY = "geomesa.auth.provider.impl";

For simple scenarios, the set of authorizations to apply to all queries
can be specified when creating the GeoMesa ``DataStore`` by using the
``geomesa.security.auths`` configuration parameter. This will use the
``DefaultAuthorizationsProvider`` implementation provided by GeoMesa.

.. code-block:: java

    // create a map containing initialization data for the GeoMesa data store
    Map<String, String> configuration = new HashMap<>();
    configuration.put("geomesa.security.auths", "user,admin");
    DataStore dataStore = DataStoreFinder.getDataStore(configuration);

If there are no ``AuthorizationsProvider``\ s found on the classpath,
and the ``geomesa.security.auths`` parameter is not set, GeoMesa will default to using
the authorizations associated with the underlying Accumulo connection
(i.e. the ``accumulo.user`` configuration value).

.. warning::

    This is not a recommended approach for a production system.

In addition, please note that the authorizations used in any scenario
cannot exceed the authorizations of the underlying Accumulo connection.

Create Visibilities in Accumulo
-------------------------------

This tutorial requires that you specify a visibility string and the associated
authorizations string. The visibilities can be anything valid for your Accumulo instance.
For the rest of this exercise, we are going to assume the visibility string is ``user``.
You can see the visibilities that are currently enabled for your user through the Accumulo shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ accumulo shell -u <username> -p <password>

Once in the shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    > getauths
    user,admin

If your user does not already have authorizations, you can add them
through the Accumulo shell with the ``addauths`` command:

.. code-block:: bash

    > getauths
    user
    > addauths -s admin -u myuser
    > getauths
    user,admin

.. note::

    A user cannot set authorizations unless the user has
    the System.ALTER\_USER permission.

After running the tutorial code, you should see a visibility label in
square brackets when you scan the index tables through the Accumulo shell:

.. code-block:: bash

    > scan -t mytable_id
    \x0100700230-fdfe-422e-b4d1-8072db6f3dda SFT: [user]    \x02\x00\x00\x01b00700230...

Download and Build the Tutorial
-------------------------------

Pick a reasonable directory on your machine, and run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/geomesa/geomesa-tutorials.git
    $ cd geomesa-tutorials

.. warning::

    Make sure that you download or checkout the version of the tutorials project that corresponds to
    your GeoMesa version. See :ref:`tutorial_versions` for more details.

To ensure that the quick start works with your environment, modify the ``pom.xml``
to set the appropriate versions for Accumulo, Hadoop, etc.

For ease of use, the project builds a bundled artifact that contains all the required
dependencies in a single JAR. To build, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mvn clean install -pl geomesa-tutorials-accumulo/geomesa-tutorials-accumulo-authorizations -am

Run the Tutorial
----------------

On the command line, run:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ java -cp geomesa-tutorials-accumulo/geomesa-tutorials-accumulo-authorizations/target/geomesa-tutorials-accumulo-authorizations-${geomesa.version}.jar \
        org.geomesa.example.accumulo.auths.AuthorizationsTutorial \
        --accumulo.instance.id <instance>                         \
        --accumulo.zookeepers <zookeepers>                        \
        --accumulo.user <user>                                    \
        --accumulo.password <password>                            \
        --accumulo.catalog <table>                                \
        --geomesa.security.auths <authorizations>                 \
        --visibilities <visibilities>


where you provide the following arguments:

-  ``<instance>`` the name of your Accumulo instance
-  ``<zookeepers>`` your Zookeeper nodes, separated by commas
-  ``<user>`` the name of an Accumulo user that has permissions to
   create, read and write tables
-  ``<password>`` the password for the previously-mentioned Accumulo
   user
-  ``<table>`` the name of the destination table that will accept these
   test records. This table should either not exist or should be empty
-  ``<visibilities>`` the visibilities label to apply to the data, e.g. ``user``
-  ``<authorizations>`` the authorizations associated with the visibilities you
   selected, e.g. ``user``. Make sure that your Accumulo user has the authorization
   you use

.. warning::

    If you have set up the GeoMesa Accumulo distributed
    runtime to be isolated within a namespace (see
    :ref:`install_accumulo_runtime_namespace`) the value of ``<table>``
    should include the namespace (e.g. ``myNamespace.geomesa``).

Optionally, you can also specify that the tutorial should delete its data upon completion. Use the
``--cleanup`` flag when you run to enable this behavior.

Once run, you should see the following output:

.. code-block:: none

The first query should return 1 or more results. The second query should

Looking at the Code
-------------------

The source code is meant to be accessible for this tutorial. The main logic is contained in
``org.geomesa.example.accumulo.auths.AuthorizationsTutorial`` in the
``geomesa-tutorials-accumulo/geomesa-tutorials-accumulo-authorizations`` module. Some relevant methods are:

-  ``createDataStore`` uses a system property to control the visibility provider used by each data store
-  ``queryFeatures`` run the same query with each data store

.. code-block:: java

    // get an instance of the data store that uses our authorizations provider,
    // that always returns empty auths
    System.setProperty(AuthorizationsProvider.AUTH_PROVIDER_SYS_PROPERTY,
                       EmptyAuthorizationsProvider.class.getName());
    unauthorizedDatastore = super.createDataStore(params);

    // get an instance of the data store that uses the default authorizations provider,
    // which will use whatever auths the connector has available
    System.setProperty(AuthorizationsProvider.AUTH_PROVIDER_SYS_PROPERTY,
                       DefaultAuthorizationsProvider.class.getName());
    return super.createDataStore(params);

This code snippet shows how you can specify the
``AuthorizationProvider`` to use with a system property. The
``DefaultAuthorizationsProvider`` class is provided by GeoMesa, and used
when no other implementations are found.

The ``EmptyAuthorizationsProvider`` class is included in the tutorial. The ``EmptyAuthorizationsProvider``
will always return an empty ``Authorizations`` object, which means that any data stored with visibilities
will not be returned.

There is a more useful implementation of ``AuthorizationsProvider`` that
will be explored in more detail in the next section, the
``LdapAuthorizationsProvider``.

Applying Authorizations and Visibilities to GeoServer Using PKIS and LDAP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section will show you how to configure GeoServer to authenticate
users with PKIs, use LDAP to store authorizations, and apply
authorizations on a per-user/per-query basis.

Basic user authentication will take place via user certificates. Each
user will have their own public/private key pair that uniquely
identifies them.

User authorizations will come from LDAP. Once a user's identity has been
verified via PKI, we will look up the user's details in LDAP.

Once we have a user's authentication and authorizations, we will apply
them to the GeoMesa query using a custom ``AuthorizationsProvider``
implementation.

Run GeoServer in Tomcat
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    If you are already running GeoServer in Tomcat, you
    can skip this step.

GeoServer ships by default with an embedded Jetty servlet. In order to
use PKI login, we need to install it in Tomcat instead.

1. Download and install `Tomcat 7 <http://tomcat.apache.org/download-70.cgi>`__.
2. Create an environment variable pointing to your tomcat installation
   (you may want to add this to your bash init scripts):

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ export CATALINA_HOME=/path/to/tomcat

3. If you want to reuse your existing GeoServer configuration, create an
   environment variable pointing to your GeoServer data directory (you
   may want to add this to your shell initialization scripts):

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ export GEOSERVER_DATA_DIR=/path/to/geoserver/data_dir

4. Copy the GeoServer webapp from the GeoServer distribution into the
   tomcat servlet:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ cp -r /path/to/geoserver/webapps/geoserver/ $CATALINA_HOME/webapps/

5. Increase the memory allocated to Tomcat, which you will need for
   running complex queries in GeoServer (the values here may not be
   applicable for every installation):

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ cd $CATALINA_HOME/bin
       $ echo 'CATALINA_OPTS="-Xmx2g -XX:MaxPermSize=128m"' >> setenv.sh

6. Start Tomcat, either as a service or through the startup scripts, and
   ensure that GeoServer is available at http://localhost:8080/geoserver/web/.

Create the Accumulo Data Store and Layer in GeoServer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Log into GeoServer using your user and password credentials. Click "Stores" and "Add new Store".
Select the ``Accumulo (GeoMesa)`` vector data source, and fill in the required parameters.

Basic store info:

-  ``workspace`` this is dependent upon your GeoServer installation
-  ``data source name`` pick a sensible name, such as ``geomesa_authorizations``
-  ``description`` this is strictly decorative; ``GeoMesa authorizations tutorial``

Connection parameters:

-  these are the same parameter values that you supplied on the
   command line when you ran the tutorial; they describe how to connect
   to the Accumulo instance where your data reside
-  ``geomesa.security.auths`` leave this field empty

Click "Save", and GeoServer will search your Accumulo table for any
GeoMesa-managed feature types.

Publish the Layer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

GeoServer should recognize the ``gdelt-secure`` feature type, and
should present that as a layer that can be published. Click on the
"Publish" link.

You will be taken to the "Edit Layer" screen. You will need to enter values for the data bounding
boxes. In this case, you can click on the link to compute these values from the data.

Click on the "Save" button when you are done.

Configure GeoServer for PKI Login
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the instructions in the GeoServer
`documentation <http://docs.geoserver.org/latest/en/user/security/tutorials/cert/index.html>`__
in order to enable PKI login to GeoServer.

In the step where you add the 'cert' filter to the 'Filter Chains', also
add it to the 'rest', 'gwc' and 'default' chains (in addition to web).

We will be using the 'rod' and 'scott' users, so be sure to install
those into your browser.

.. warning::

    Make sure that you click the 'Save' button on all
    GeoServer screens. Otherwise, your changes may be lost.

Verify that the changes were applied by re-starting Tomcat, and checking
that the 'web' filter chain has the 'cert' filter selected:

.. figure:: _static/geomesa-examples-authorizations/filter-chain-cert.jpg

Install an LDAP Server for Storing Authorizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. note::

    If you are already have an LDAP server set up, you
    can skip this step.

1. Download and install
   `ApacheDS <http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/>`__
2. Either run as a service, or run through the start scripts:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd apacheds-2.0.0-M20/bin
    $ chmod 755 *.sh
    $ ./apacheds.sh 

Configure LDAP for Storing Authorizations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We want to configure LDAP with a user to match the Spring Security PKIs
we are testing with. The end result we want is to create the following
user:

.. code::

    DN: cn=rod,ou=Spring Security,o=Spring Framework

In order to do that, we will use Apache Directory Studio.

1. Download and run `Apache Directory
   Studio <http://directory.apache.org/studio/>`__.
2. Connect to the your LDAP instance (ApacheDS), using the instructions
   `here <http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/basic-ug/1.4.2-changing-admin-password.html>`__
   (note: you do not need to change the password unless you want to).
3. Create a partition for our data:

   1. Right-click the 'ApacheDS (localhost)' entry under the
      'Connection' tab and select 'Open Configuration'.
   2. Click 'Advanced Partitions Configuration...'.
   3. Click 'Add'.
   4. Set the ID field to be 'Spring Framework'.
   5. Set the Suffix field to be 'o=Spring Framework'.
   6. Uncheck 'Auto-generate context entry from suffix DN'.
   7. Set the following attributes in Context Entry:

      -  objectclass: extensibleObject
      -  objectclass: top
      -  objectclass: domain
      -  dc: Spring Framework2
      -  o: Spring Framework2

   8. Hit **Ctrl-s** to save the partition. |ApacheDS Partition|

4. **Restart ApacheDS.** Otherwise the partition will not be available
   and the LDIF import will fail.
5. Load the following LDIF file, which will create the Spring Security
   OU and the 'rod' user:

   -  :download:`spring-security-rod.ldif <_static/geomesa-examples-authorizations/spring-security-rod.ldif>`
   -  Right-click the 'Root DSE' node in the LDAP browser, and select
      'Import->LDIF import...'

Test LDAP Connection Using Tutorial Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The tutorial code includes an ``AuthorizationsProvider`` implementation
that will connect to LDAP to retrieve authorizations, in the class
``com.example.geomesa.auths.LdapAuthorizationsProvider``.

The provider will configure itself based on the
``geomesa-ldap.properties`` file on the classpath (under
``src/main/resources``):

.. code-block:: properties

    # ldap connection properties
    java.naming.factory.initial=com.sun.jndi.ldap.LdapCtxFactory
    java.naming.provider.url=ldap://localhost:10389
    java.naming.security.authentication=simple
    java.naming.security.principal=uid=admin,ou=system
    java.naming.security.credentials=secret

    # the ldap node to start the query from
    geomesa.ldap.search.root=o=Spring Framework
    # the query that will be applied to find the user's record
    # the '{}' will be replaced with the common name from the certificate the user has logged in with
    geomesa.ldap.search.filter=(&(objectClass=person)(cn={}))
    # the ldap attribute that holds the comma-delimited authorizations for the user
    geomesa.ldap.auths.attribute=employeeType

The default file included with the tutorial will connect to the LDAP
instance we set up in the previous steps. If you are using a different
LDAP configuration, you will need to modify the file appropriately.

The ``LdapAuthorizationsProvider`` will look for a particular LDAP
attribute that stores the user's authorizations in a comma-delimited
list. For simplicity, in this tutorial we have re-purposed an existing
attribute, ``employeeType``. The attribute to use can be modified
through the property file.

When we inserted the 'rod' record into LDAP, we set his ``employeeType``
to 'user,admin', corresponding to our Accumulo authorizations. If you
are using different authorizations, you will need to update the
attribute to match.

The tutorial code includes a test case for connecting to LDAP, in the
class ``LdapAuthorizationsProviderTest``.

Once you have modified ``geomesa-ldap.properties`` to connect to your
LDAP, you can test the connection by running this test class:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ java -cp geomesa-tutorials-accumulo/geomesa-tutorials-accumulo-authorizations/target/geomesa-tutorials-accumulo-authorizations-${geomesa.version}.jar \
        org.geomesa.example.accumulo.auths.LdapAuthorizationsProviderTest rod

The argument to the program ('rod') is the user to retrieve
authorizations for. You should get the following output:

.. code-block:: bash

    Checking auths from LDAP for user 'rod'
    Retrieved auths: user,admin

Installing the LDAP AuthorizationProvider in GeoServer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use the ``LdapAuthorizationsProvider``, we need to install
it as a service provider into GeoServer, where it will automatically be
picked up by GeoMesa.

The tutorial code includes a service provider registry in the
``META-INF/services`` folder. By default, the provider class is
specified as the ``EmptyAuthorizationsProvider``.

1. Ensure that your LDAP configuration is correct by running
   ``LdapAuthorizationsProviderTest``, as described above.
2. Change the provider class in the single line file
   ``src/main/resources/META-INF/services/org.locationtech.geomesa.security.AuthorizationsProvider``
   to be
   ``org.geomesa.example.accumulo.auths.LdapAuthorizationsProvider``
3. Rebuild the tutorial JAR and install the **unshaded original** jar
   in GeoServer:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ mvn clean install -pl geomesa-tutorials-accumulo/geomesa-tutorials-accumulo-authorizations
       $ cp geomesa-tutorials-accumulo/geomesa-tutorials-accumulo-authorizations/target/geomesa-tutorials-accumulo-authorizations-${geomesa.version}.jar \
           /path/to/tomcat/webapps/geoserver/WEB-INF/lib/

.. note::

    We want to use the unshaded jar since all the
    required dependencies are already installed in GeoServer.

4. Restart GeoServer (or start it if it is not running).

At this point you should have everything configured and in-place.

Verifying the LDAP Authorizations in GeoServer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to verify that the authorizations are working correctly,
execute a query against GeoMesa by calling the WMS provider over HTTPS
in your browser:

.. code-block:: bash

    https://localhost:8443/geoserver/wms?service=WMS&version=1.1.0&request=GetMap&layers=geomesa:gdelt_auths&styles=&bbox=31.6,44,37.4,47.75&width=1200&height=600&srs=EPSG:4326&format=application/openlayers

When prompted, select the 'rod' certificate.

You should see the normal data come back, with many red points
indicating the data:

.. figure:: _static/geomesa-quickstart-gdelt-data/geoserver-layer-preview.png
   :alt: Authorized Results

   Authorized Results

Now try the same query, but use the 'scott' certificate. This time,
there should be no data returned, as the 'scott' user does not have any
authorizations set up in LDAP.

.. note::

    A simple way to use different certificates at once
    is to open multiple 'incognito' or 'private' browser windows.
