NiFi 2 Support
--------------

GeoMesa NiFi now supports NiFi 2.x. NiFi 1.x is still supported, but note that it now requires running on Java 21+.

Parquet Encoding Changes
------------------------

The default format used for writing Parquet files in the FileSystem data store has been updated to conform to the
`GeoParquet <https://geoparquet.org/releases/v1.1.0/>`__ specification, which makes the files compatible with the
broader ecosystem, including GeoPandas, Apache Sedona, DuckDB, and Apache Iceberg. However, older versions of
GeoMesa will not be able to read the files. For back-compatibility, the file format may be configured to write
the old format; see :ref:`fsds_parquet_geometries_prop` for details.

As part of this change, the bundled version of Parquet has been updated to ``1.15.1``. Any files written with the
newer version may not be readable with older versions of Parquet.
