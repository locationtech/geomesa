Version 3.5.0
+++++++++++++

Removal of Log4j
----------------

GeoMesa has been updated to ban all usages of ``log4j``, to mitigate various CVEs present in that framework. In
most cases, GeoMesa uses ``slf4j``, and delegates to the logging framework of the runtime environment.
However, this change impacts the JARs bundled with the command-line tools, which now ship with
`reload4j <https://reload4j.qos.ch/>`__ instead. Other environments using GeoMesa (i.e. GeoServer) must be
hardened independently.

Kafka Serialization
-------------------

The GeoMesa Kafka data store now supports a new serialization format, ``avro-native``. This format uses Avro
array and map types for ``List`` and ``Map`` type attributes, which makes it easier to read with standard Avro
tools. Note that GeoMesa versions before 3.5.0 will not be able to consume topics written in this format.

Deprecated Modules
------------------

The following modules have been deprecated, and will be removed in a future version:

* GeoMesa Bigtable

Dependency Updates
------------------

* org.slf4j:slf4j-api: ``1.7.25`` -> ``1.7.36``
* com.google.code.gson:gson: ``2.8.1`` -> ``2.8.9``
