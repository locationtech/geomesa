Version 5.1.0

Version Compatibility
---------------------

GeoMesa 5.1.x is generally compatible with versions 5.0.x, 4.0.x and 3.5.x across different environments. This means that
it is possible to upgrade in parts; i.e. upgrade GeoServer to 5.1.0 but keep NiFi at 3.5.2. Please note that
previously deprecated functionality (see below) may no longer work once any part of the environment is upgraded to
5.1.0.
