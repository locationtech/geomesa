Partitioned PostGIS Index Configuration
=======================================

GeoMesa exposes a variety of configuration options that can be used to customize and optimize a given installation.
See :ref:`set_sft_options` for details on setting configuration parameters. Note that most of the general options
for GeoMesa stores are not supported by the partitioned PostGIS store, except as specified below.

Configuring the Default Date Attribute
--------------------------------------

The default date attribute is the attribute that will be used for sorting data into partitions. See
:ref:`set_date_attribute` for details on how to specify it.

Configuring Indices
-------------------

Attributes in the feature type may be marked for indexing, which will create a B-tree index on the associated
table column. See :ref:`attribute_indices` for details on how to specify indices.

Configuring Partition Size
--------------------------

Each feature type can be configured for a particular partition size. The partition size is specified as the number
of hours that each partition will cover, and must be a divisor of 24, i.e. ``1``, ``2``, ``3``, ``4``, ``6``,
``8``, ``12`` or ``24``.

The number of hours should be based on the expected volume of data and type of queries. Due to partition
pruning, PostGIS will not need to scan partitions that fall outside a given query window.

Partition size is configured with the key ``pg.partitions.interval.hours``.

.. code-block:: java

    SimpleFeatureType sft = ....;
    sft.getUserData().put("pg.partitions.interval.hours", "12");

Configuring Data Age-Off
------------------------

Each feature type can be configured to automatically drop partitions older than a certain threshold. This
is accomplished by setting the maximum number of partitions to keep. The age of the data will depend on
the number of hours in each partition (see above). For example, keeping 14 partitions where each partition
is 12 hours will keep the last week's worth of data.

If not specified, data will not be dropped automatically.

Age-off is configured with the key ``pg.partitions.max``.

.. code-block:: java

    SimpleFeatureType sft = ....;
    sft.getUserData().put("pg.partitions.max", "14");

Configuring Tablespaces
-----------------------

Each feature type can be configured to use different tablespaces for the different partition tables. Since
all the writes initially go to the write-ahead table, having it on a fast disk may be beneficial. Conversely,
since the main partitions are written once and not generally updated, having them on slower storage may be
acceptable.

Any configured tablespaces must already exist in the PostreSQL instance being used.

Tablespaces are configured with the keys ``pg.partitions.tablespace.wa``, ``pg.partitions.tablespace.wa-partitions``
and ``pg.partitions.tablespace.main``. See :ref:`pg_partition_table_design` for details on the different tables.

.. code-block:: java

    SimpleFeatureType sft = ....;
    sft.getUserData().put("pg.partitions.tablespace.wa", "fasttablespace");

Configuring the Maintenance Schedule
------------------------------------

Maintenance scripts are run every 10 minutes to move data between the write-ahead table and the partitioned tables.
By default, the schedule is randomized to avoid all feature types running maintenance at the same time. To specify
the exact minute that the scripts should run, use the key ``pg.partitions.cron.minute``.

The scheduled minute must be between 0 and 8, inclusive. For example, setting the scheduled minute to 1 will
cause the scripts to run at 00:01, 00:11, 00:21, 00:31, etc.

The write-ahead table gets rolled over on the 9th minute of each ten minute block. Thus, running maintenance
at minute 0 will move data out of the write-ahead table the fastest. Since the write-ahead table must be read
for each query, moving data out of it faster may improve performance.

.. code-block:: java

    SimpleFeatureType sft = ....;
    sft.getUserData().put("pg.partitions.cron.minute", "0");
