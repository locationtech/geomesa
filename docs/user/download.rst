Maven Integration
-----------------

GeoMesa artifacts are hosted on Maven Central. However, there are several required third-party libraries
that are only available in other repositories. To include GeoMesa in your project, add the following
repositories to your pom:

.. code-block:: xml

    <repositories>
      <!-- geotools -->
      <repository>
        <id>osgeo</id>
        <url>https://repo.osgeo.org/repository/release</url>
      </repository>
      <!-- confluent -->
      <repository>
        <id>confluent</id>
        <url>https://packages.confluent.io/maven/</url>
      </repository>
    </repositories>

and then include the desired ``geomesa-*`` dependencies:

Source Code
-----------

To build and install the source distribution requires:

* `Java JDK 11 <https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/>`__
* `Apache Maven <https://maven.apache.org/>`__ |maven_version|

Source can be cloned using `Git <https://git-scm.com/>`__ or downloaded from `GitHub`__.

__ https://github.com/locationtech/geomesa/archive/main.tar.gz

To build, change to the source directory and use Maven:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ mvn clean install

The full build takes quite a while. To speed it up, you may skip tests and use multiple threads. GeoMesa also
provides the script ``build/mvn``, which is a wrapper around Maven that downloads and runs
`Zinc <https://github.com/typesafehub/zinc>`__, a fast incremental compiler:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ build/mvn clean install -T8 -DskipTests

Upgrading
---------
