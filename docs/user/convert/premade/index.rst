Prepackaged Converter Definitions
=================================

GeoMesa Tools distributions contain several prepackaged converters for common, publicly
available data sources. These converters are bundled with the command-line tools
in the GeoMesa binary distributions, in individual directories under ``conf/sfts``,
which are included by the ``conf/reference.conf`` file.

.. note::

    The examples in the sections below are often specific to the GeoMesa Accumulo distribution,
    but the general principle is the same for each distribution. Only the home variable
    (e.g. ``$GEOMESA_ACCUMULO_HOME``) and command-line tool name will differ depending on
    GeoMesa distribution.
