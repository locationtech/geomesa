Kafka Command-Line Tools
========================

The GeoMesa Kafka distribution includes a set of command-line tools for feature
management, ingest, export and debugging.

To install the tools, see :ref:`setting_up_kafka_commandline`.

Once installed, the tools should be available through the command ``geomesa-kafka``::

    $ geomesa-kafka
    INFO  Usage: geomesa-kafka [command] [command options]
      Commands:
        ...

Commands that are common to multiple back ends are described in :doc:`/user/cli/index`. The commands
here are Kafka-specific.

General Arguments
-----------------

Most commands require you to specify the connection to Kafka. This generally includes the list of Kafka brokers, specified
with ``--brokers`` (or ``-b``), and the catalog topic for storing metadata, specified with ``--catalog`` (or ``-c``).
Connection properties can be specified with ``--producer-config`` for producers, ``--consumer-config`` for consumers, or
``--config`` which will be applied to both. See the official Kafka documentation for the available
`producer <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#producerconfigs>`_ and
`consumer <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#consumerconfigs>`_ configs.

When using the legacy Zookeeper metadata persistence, the Zookeeper servers must be specified with ``--zookeepers`` (or
``-z``). The Zookeeper path for storing metadata can be specified with ``--zkpath`` (or ``-p``), which supersedes ``--catalog``.
See :ref:`no_zookeeper` for details on migrating away from Zookeeper.

To connect to :ref:`Confluent Schema Registry <confluent_kds>` topics, use ``--schema-registry``
to provide the registry URL.

The ``--auths`` argument corresponds to the data store parameter ``geomesa.security.auths``. See
:ref:`data_security` for more information.

Commands
--------

``create-schema``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See :ref:`cli_create_schema` for an overview of this command.

In addition to the regular options, Kafka allows the number of partitions and the replication factor of
the Kafka topic to be specified.

======================== ==================================================
Argument                 Description
======================== ==================================================
``--partitions``         The number of partitions used for the Kafka topic
``--replication``        The replication factor for the Kafka topic
======================== ==================================================

``export``
^^^^^^^^^^

See :ref:`cli_export` for an overview of this command.

Unlike the standard ``export``, this command will not not terminate until it is cancelled (through a shell interrupt)
or until ``--max-features`` have been read. Thus, it can be used to monitor a topic.

This command differs from the ``listen`` command (below) in that it allows filtering and output in various formats.
It will also ignore ``drop`` and ``clear`` messages generated by feature deletion.

In addition to the regular options, Kafka allows control over the consumer behavior:

======================== ================================================================================
Argument                 Description
======================== ================================================================================
``--from-beginning``     Start reading messages from the beginning of the Kafka topic, instead of the end
``--num-consumers``      Number of consumers used to read the topic
======================== ================================================================================

The ``--num-consumers`` argument can be used to increase read speed. However, there can be at most one
consumer per topic partition.

The ``--from-beginning`` argument can be used to start reading the Kafka topic from the start. Otherwise,
only new messages that are sent after this command is invoked will be read.

``ingest``
^^^^^^^^^^

See :ref:`cli_ingest` for an overview of this command.

In addition to the regular options, Kafka allows the number of partitions and the replication factor of
the Kafka topic to be specified. In addition, an artificial delay can be inserted to simulate a live data stream.

======================== ==================================================
Argument                 Description
======================== ==================================================
``--partitions``         The number of partitions used for the Kafka topic
``--replication``        The replication factor for the Kafka topic
``--serialization``      The serialization format to use
``--delay``              The delay inserted between messages
======================== ==================================================

The ``--delay`` argument should be specified as a duration, in plain language. For example, ``100 millis``
or ``1 second``. The ingest will pause after creating each ``SimpleFeature`` for the specified delay.
This can be used to simulate a live data stream.

``playback``
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The playback command can simulate a data stream by replaying features from a file directly on to a Kafka Data Store.
Features are returned based on a date attribute in the feature. For example, if replaying three features that have dates that
are each one second apart, each feature will be emitted after a delay of one second. The rate of export can be modified to
speed up or slow down the original time differences.

The playback command is an extension of the :ref:`cli_ingest` command, and accepts all the parameters outlined there.
Additionally, it accepts the following parameters:

======================== =========================================================
Argument                 Description
======================== =========================================================
``--dtg``                Date attribute to base playback on. If not specified,
                         will use the default schema date field
``--rate``               Rate multiplier to speed-up (or slow down) features being
                         returned, as a float
``--live``               Will modify the returned dates to match the current time
======================== =========================================================

.. note::

    Input files (specified in ``--src-list`` or ``<files>...``) must be time-ordered by the ``--dtg``
    attribute before ingest or the playback will not work as expected.

The ``--rate`` parameter can be used to speed up or slow down the replay. It is specified as a floating point
number. For example ``--rate 10`` will make replay ten times faster, while ``--rate 0.1`` will make replay
ten times slower.

``listen``
^^^^^^^^^^

This command behaves similarly to the ``export`` command (above), but it does not provide options
for filtering or output format. It will show each message on the Kafka topic, including ``drop`` and
``clear`` messages generated from feature deletion.

This command will not not terminate until it is cancelled (through a shell interrupt).

======================== ================================================================================
Argument                 Description
======================== ================================================================================
``-f, --feature-name *`` The name of the schema
``--from-beginning``     Start reading messages from the beginning of the Kafka topic, instead of the end
``--num-consumers``      Number of consumers used to read the topic
======================== ================================================================================

The ``--num-consumers`` argument can be used to increase read speed. However, there can be at most one
consumer per topic partition.

The ``--from-beginning`` argument can be used to start reading the Kafka topic from the start. Otherwise,
only new messages that are sent after this command is invoked will be read.

``migrate-zookeeper-metadata``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command will migrate schema metadata out of Zookeeper. For additional information, see :ref:`no_zookeeper`.

======================== ================================================================================
Argument                 Description
======================== ================================================================================
``--delete``             Delete the metadata out of Zookeeper after migrating it
======================== ================================================================================
