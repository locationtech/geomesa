GeoMesa NiFi Bundle
===================

`Apache NiFi <https://nifi.apache.org/>`__ is an "easy to use, powerful, and reliable system to process and
distribute data." GeoMesa-NiFi allows you to ingest data into GeoMesa straight from NiFi by leveraging
custom processors.

GeoMesa-NiFi is a separate project hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/geomesa/geomesa-nifi/>`__.

To get started with NiFi, try the :doc:`/tutorials/geomesa-quickstart-nifi` tutorial.

For more information on setting up or using NiFi see the `Apache NiFi
User Guide <https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/user-guide.html>`__.
