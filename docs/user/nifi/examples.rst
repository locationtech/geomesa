Ingest a GeoMesa Kafka Topic into HBase
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common use case is to store the most recent state of an object in a GeoMesa Kafka data store to drive a live map
view, and to persist every state of the object into long-term storage in HBase or Accumulo for history and
analytics. This example will show how to pull data off a GeoMesa Kafka topic, and persist it in HBase with
minimal configuration.

Install the GeoMesa NARs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Follow the steps under :ref:`nifi_install` to install the GeoMesa processors in your NiFi instance. This
tutorial requires the GeoMesa Kafka and HBase NARs, as well as the standard GeoMesa service NARs.

Add and Configure the Processors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first step is to add two processors to your flow, a ``GetGeoMesaKafkaRecord`` processor and an
``AvroToPutGeoMesaHBase`` processor. Connect the output of the ``Get`` processor to the input of the ``Put``
processor:

   :align: center

For a robust system, you would want to add further processing for handling successes and failures. For
this example, just auto-terminate all other connections for simplicity.

Next, create a new controller service by clicking 'Configure' on the NiFi flow, then going to the Controller
Services tab and clicking the ``+`` button, then selecting the ``GeoAvroRecordSetWriterFactory``. The
``GeoAvroRecordSetWriterFactory`` can be left with its default configuration, which is to use NiFi expressions.
The ``GetGeoMesaKafkaRecord`` processor will populate the necessary attributes according to the feature type
being read:

The ``GetGeoMesaKafkaRecord`` processor will pull data off of the GeoMesa Kafka topic and write it out using
a NiFi record writer. The processor can output data in any format supported by the NiFi records API, but for
this example we're going to use GeoAvro to simplify the ingest into HBase. Configure the processor by
setting the appropriate Kafka connection parameters and setting the ``GeoAvroRecordWriterFactory`` you just
created for the output. Set a unique Kafka group ID, to ensure that the processor reads all the data coming
from the topic:

   :align: center

The ``AvroToPutGeoMesaHBase`` processor will read most the necessary configuration from the GeoAvro file, but
you still need to configure it with the ``hbase-site.xml`` file for your cluster, which will let it connect to HBase,
and a catalog table, which is where it will write out data:

   :align: center

Once all the processors and controller services are configured, enable them in the NiFi UI. If everything
goes correctly, you'll start seeing your Kafka data show up in HBase.
