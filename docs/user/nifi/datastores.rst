Data Store Services
-------------------

GeoMesa processors require a ``DataStoreService`` to connect to the back-end data source. The following
data stores are available in GeoMesa:

HBase
~~~~~

The ``HBaseDataStoreService`` controller service can be used to ingest data into an HBase-backed GeoMesa datastore.
To use this controller services, first add one to the workspace and open the properties tab of its configuration.
For a description of the connection properties, see :ref:`hbase_parameters`.

Accumulo
~~~~~~~~

The ``AccumuloDataStoreService`` controller service can be used to ingest data into an Accumulo-backed GeoMesa
datastore. To use this controller services, first add one to the workspace and open the properties tab of its
configuration. For a description of the connection properties, see :ref:`accumulo_parameters`.

FileSystem
~~~~~~~~~~

The ``FileSystemDataStoreService`` controller service can be used to ingest data into a file-system-backed
GeoMesa datastore. To use this controller services, first add one to the workspace and open the properties tab of
its configuration. For a description of the connection properties, see :ref:`fsds_parameters`.

Kafka
~~~~~

The ``KafkaDataStoreService`` controller service can be used to ingest data into a Kafka-backed
GeoMesa datastore. To use this controller services, first add one to the workspace and open the properties tab of
its configuration. For a description of the connection properties, see :ref:`kafka_parameters`.

Redis
~~~~~

The ``RedisDataStoreService`` controller service can be used to ingest data into a Redis-backed
GeoMesa datastore. To use this controller services, first add one to the workspace and open the properties tab of
its configuration. For a description of the connection properties, see :ref:`redis_parameters`.

PostGIS
~~~~~~~

The ``PostgisDataStoreService`` and ``PartitionedPostgisDataStoreService`` controller services can be used to ingest
data into PostGIS. To use one of these controller services, first add it to the workspace and open the properties
tab of its configuration. For a description of the connection properties, see :ref:`pg_partition_parameters`.

GeoTools
~~~~~~~~

The ``GeoToolsDataStoreService`` controller services can be used to ingest data into arbitrary GeoTools data stores.
For a list of stores provided by GeoTools, see the GeoTools
`documentation <https://docs.geotools.org/latest/javadocs/org/geotools/data/DataStoreFactorySpi.html>`_.
The data store and its dependencies need to be made available to the controller service through the ``ExtraClasspaths``
property. Once available, the data store should appear in the ``DataStoreName`` property drop-down. Selecting the
data store will display its configuration parameters.
