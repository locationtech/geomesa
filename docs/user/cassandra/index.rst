Cassandra Data Store
====================

The GeoMesa Cassandra Data Store is found in the ``geomesa-cassandra``
in the source distribution.

The GeoMesa Cassandra DataStore provides a GeoTools API backed by Cassandra for geospatial data.  Currently, the
implementation is very much alpha - we are actively soliciting help in making this a robust library for handling
geospatial data within Cassandra.  See the note below on things to do and ways you can help out.
